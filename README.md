# Creating some page templates

In this repo I am setting up a number of boilerplate page layouts. Because I work with a few static site generators, each page template will also include a directory of partials and templates, marked up with a templating language.
* Liquid, Handlebars?

Both styled only with Sass, and styled using CSS frameworks.
* Bootstrap, Foundation, Tachyons?

As such, I say take it and do what you will. Please do pay attention, though, to the very liberal terms laid out in the two licenses I have outlined in the [LICENSE.md]().
