# Creating some page templates

The purpose of this repository is to:
1. Create a number of boilerplate page layouts that I can quickly put to use
2. Begin to define my base styles for web design and development
3. Because I work with a few static site generators, each page template will also include a directory of partials and templates, marked up with a templating language (Liquid, Handlebars?).
4. Both styled only with Sass, and styled using CSS frameworks (Bootstrap, Foundation, Tachyons?)
