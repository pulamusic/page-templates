# NOTES

Set up a listing of all CSS defaults in `/css-frameworks`:
* Regular CSS defaults
* Bootstrap defaults
* Foundation defaults
* Tachyons defaults

Create some boilerplate browser sizes with their attendant SASS mixins.
* Check out [browsersize.com](https://browsersize.com/)

I let the SASS get ahead of me. I need to simplify everything, clone certain parts of the repo, and create progressively more detailed templates. Try this with creating the content for `/post-container`.
